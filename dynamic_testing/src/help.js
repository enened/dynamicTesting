                You just have to enter the type of test you want generated, and your test will be created. 
                You can include the subject, grade level, language, topics, and or number of questions you want. 
                It will automatically grade the test and will also provide an explanation as to why the correct answer is correct. 
                If you're logged in, you can save the test which will also save your score, so the next time you log back in, 
                you can see your previous score and retake the same test.
